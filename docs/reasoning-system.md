# Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning System Documentation

## Overview

The Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning System combines the strengths of neural networks (deep learning) with symbolic reasoning (rule-based logic) to create a more robust, transparent, and reliable AI reasoning capability. This hybrid approach allows the system to handle both pattern recognition tasks and logical deduction while providing explainable results.

## Key Features

1. **Hybrid Reasoning Architecture**
   - Neural components for pattern recognition and generalization
   - Symbolic components for logical operations and rule application
   - Bidirectional information flow between neural and symbolic systems

2. **Explicit Reasoning Steps**
   - Multi-step reasoning processes with clear intermediate steps
   - Trackable logic flow from premises to conclusions
   - Confidence scoring for individual reasoning steps

3. **Self-Assessment Capabilities**
   - Evaluation of reasoning quality and confidence
   - Detection of logical fallacies and inconsistencies
   - Identification of knowledge gaps and uncertainties

4. **Problem Decomposition**
   - Breaking complex problems into manageable sub-problems
   - Applying appropriate reasoning strategies to each sub-problem
   - Recombining solutions with consistent logic

## Architecture Components

### Operation Types

The reasoning system implements three types of operations:

1. **Logical Operations**
   - Deduction: Drawing conclusions from premises
   - Induction: Inferring general rules from specific examples
   - Abduction: Forming likely explanations for observations
   - Analogy: Transferring knowledge between similar domains

2. **Neural Operations**
   - Pattern recognition: Identifying patterns in complex data
   - Generalization: Applying learned patterns to new scenarios
   - Contextual understanding: Interpreting information within context
   - Similarity assessment: Evaluating semantic relationships

3. **Symbolic Operations**
   - Rule application: Applying formal rules to specific cases
   - Constraint satisfaction: Finding solutions that meet requirements
   - Knowledge representation: Structuring information for reasoning
   - Logical verification: Checking consistency of arguments

### Reasoning Process

The reasoning process follows a structured flow:

1. **Problem Analysis**
   - Parsing input to extract key components
   - Identifying required knowledge domains
   - Selecting appropriate reasoning operations

2. **Planning Phase**
   - Determining optimal sequence of operations
   - Allocating operations to neural vs. symbolic components
   - Establishing verification checkpoints

3. **Execution Phase**
   - Performing operations in planned sequence
   - Recording intermediate results and confidence scores
   - Detecting and handling errors or inconsistencies

4. **Integration Phase**
   - Combining results from different reasoning paths
   - Resolving conflicts between competing conclusions
   - Synthesizing coherent final output

5. **Verification Phase**
   - Validating conclusions against premises
   - Checking logical consistency
   - Assessing overall confidence

## Example Usage

### Basic Reasoning Task

```javascript
// Client-side example
async function performReasoning(input) {
  const response = await fetch('/api/ai/reason', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      input,
      detailedOutput: true
    })
  });
  
  return await response.json();
}

// Example usage:
// "If all humans are mortal, and Socrates is human, what can we conclude about Socrates?"
```

### Domain-Specific Reasoning

```javascript
// Client-side example for mathematical reasoning
async function solveMathProblem(problem) {
  const response = await fetch('/api/ai/reason', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      input: problem,
      operationSet: 'mathematical_reasoning',
      maxSteps: 15,
      detailedOutput: true
    })
  });
  
  return await response.json();
}

// Example usage:
// "Solve the quadratic equation x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0"
```

### Multi-Step Problem Solving

```javascript
// Client-side example for complex problem decomposition
async function solveProblem(problem) {
  // First, analyze the problem to break it down
  const analysisResponse = await fetch('/api/ai/reason', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      input: `Analyze this problem and break it into sub-problems: ${problem}`,
      operationSet: 'logical_analysis',
      detailedOutput: false
    })
  });
  
  const analysis = await analysisResponse.json();
  const subProblems = JSON.parse(analysis.conclusion).subproblems;
  
  // Solve each sub-problem
  const subSolutions = await Promise.all(
    subProblems.map(async (subProblem) => {
      const subResponse = await fetch('/api/ai/reason', {
        method: 'POST',

## Integration with Knowledge System

The reasoning system integrates with the knowledge management system:

1. **Knowledge Retrieval**
   - Automatically retrieves relevant knowledge for reasoning tasks
   - Incorporates domain-specific knowledge into reasoning processes
   - Uses confidence scores to weight knowledge reliability

2. **Knowledge Generation**
   - Creates new knowledge entries from reliable reasoning conclusions
   - Tags knowledge with domains and confidence scores
   - Establishes relationships between related knowledge entries

## Advanced Capabilities

### Counterfactual Reasoning

The system can explore hypothetical scenarios by:
- Temporarily modifying knowledge base assumptions
- Tracing logical implications of counterfactual premises
- Comparing counterfactual conclusions with factual ones

```json
{
  "input": "What would happen to Earth's climate if the atmosphere contained twice as much CO2?",
  "operationSet": "counterfactual_reasoning",
  "counterfactualAssumptions": [
    "Atmospheric CO2 is double the current level"
  ]
}
```

### Uncertainty Handling

The system explicitly represents and reasons with uncertainty:
- Propagates uncertainty through reasoning steps
- Uses probability theory for uncertain inferences
- Reports confidence intervals for numerical conclusions

### Contradictions and Inconsistencies

When contradictions arise, the system:
- Identifies the specific inconsistency
- Traces back to contributing premises
- Suggests possible resolutions
- Provides alternative reasoning paths
