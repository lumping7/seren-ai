# Seren: Hyperintelligent AI Dev Team

Seren is a bleeding-edge hybrid AI system that integrates Qwen2.5-omni-7b and OlympicCoder-7B models with advanced neuro-symbolic reasoning capabilities, designed for intelligent and adaptive software development.

## Overview

Seren represents the future of AI-driven development, functioning as a hyperintelligent dev team where two specialized models work together as architects and builders. Operating in a sandbox environment with a plan-optimize-verify workflow, the system delivers production-ready software from simple prompts.

### Key Components

- **Hybrid AI Model Architecture**: Combines Qwen2.5-omni-7b and OlympicCoder-7B models for a powerful, complementary system
- **Advanced Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning Engine**: Enhances solutions with formal logic, causal reasoning, and symbolic manipulation
- **Model Communication System**: Allows models to question each other when stuck, fostering collaborative problem-solving
- **Self-Improvement Mechanisms**: Includes autonomous training with federated learning and extension capabilities
- **Memory Management**: Incorporates episodic, semantic, and procedural memory systems
- **Quantum-Resistant Security**: Features post-quantum cryptography for secure communication

## Architecture

The system is structured with these main components:

```

│   ├── ai_memory.py    # Memory management
│   ├── ai_execution.py # Code execution
│   ├── ai_autonomy.py  # Autonomous decision making
│   ├── model_communication.py  # Model communication
│   └── api.py          # API interface
├── ai_evolution/       # Self-improvement capabilities
│   ├── ai_upgrader.py  # System upgrading
│   ├── ai_extension_manager.py  # Extension management
│   ├── ai_auto_training.py  # Autonomous training
│   └── model_creator.py  # Specialized model creation
└── security/           # Security components
    └── quantum_encryption.py  # Quantum-resistant encryption
```

## Collaboration Modes

Seren supports three distinct modes of operation:

1. **Collaborative Mode**: Models work together, sharing insights and reasoning steps
2. **Specialized Mode**: Models focus on their respective strengths (architecture vs. implementation)
3. **Competitive Mode**: Models independently develop solutions, which are then compared and merged

## Technologies

- **AI Foundation**: Python-based infrastructure with support for multiple model backends
- **Reasoning**: Neuro-symbolic integration combining neural networks with symbolic logic
- **Execution**: Sandboxed environment for secure code execution and testing
- **API**: FastAPI interface for programmatic access to all capabilities
- **Security**: Post-quantum cryptographic algorithms for future-proof security

## Getting Started

To run the Seren system locally:

1. Ensure Python 3.10+ is installed
2. Install required packages:
   ```
   pip install fastapi uvicorn pydantic
   ```
3. Start the server:
   ```
   python ai_core/api.py
   ```
4. Access the API at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

## API Documentation

The Seren API provides endpoints for:

- `/api/query` - Main query interface
- `/api/communication` - Model-to-model communication
