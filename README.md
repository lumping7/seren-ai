# Advanced AI Collaboration System

An advanced AI system that combines Llama3 and Gemma3 models with neuro-symbolic reasoning, dynamic knowledge management, and self-improvement capabilities - all managed through a modern web dashboard.

## System Overview

This system represents a state-of-the-art approach to AI collaboration, where multiple large language models work together as a cohesive team, with Llama3 functioning as the "architect" and Gemma3 as the "builder". The architecture includes:

1. **Hybrid AI Engine**: Three collaboration modes between models (collaborative, specialized, competitive)
2. **Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning**: Combining neural networks with symbolic reasoning for enhanced problem-solving
3. **Dynamic Knowledge Integration**: Self-learning, persistent knowledge base that grows over time
4. **Resource-Adaptive Processing**: Scales from modest 16GB servers to high-end infrastructure
5. **Human-Like Model Conversations**: Multi-turn conversations between models with different interaction styles

The system is designed to function as a complete AI development team that can deliver production-ready software from simple prompts.

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is available in the `/docs` directory:

- [Knowledge Management System](docs/knowledge-system.md): Details on the self-learning knowledge system
- [Model Collaboration System](docs/model-collaboration.md): Architecture of the hybrid AI engine

## Key Features

### 1. Hybrid AI Architecture

The hybrid AI architecture combines the strengths of multiple models:

- **Llama3 (Architect)**: Specialized in logical reasoning, system design, architectural decisions
- **Gemma3 (Builder)**: Specialized in implementation details, creative solutions, user experience

Three collaboration modes provide flexibility:

- **Collaborative Mode**: Both models contribute to parts of the response based on their strengths
- **Specialized Mode**: System automatically selects the best model for the task
- **Competitive Mode**: Both models generate complete responses, and the best one is selected

### 2. Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning

The reasoning system combines the strengths of neural networks and symbolic processing:

- Explicit reasoning steps with verifiable logic
- Self-assessment of confidence and uncertainty
- Multi-stage problem decomposition
- Error detection and correction capabilities

### 3. Dynamic Knowledge Integration

The knowledge system enables continuous learning and adaptation:

- Automatically extracts valuable insights from model interactions
- Allows direct knowledge injection from users
- Organizes knowledge into domains with relationship mapping
- Enhances prompts with relevant contextual knowledge
- Self-maintains by identifying outdated or low-value information

### 4. Resource-Adaptive Processing

The system intelligently adapts to available computing resources:

- Scales from 16GB RAM servers to unlimited high-performance infrastructure
- Automatically detects available resources and selects appropriate processing modes
- Adjusts parameters like context length, model precision, and concurrency
- Provides graceful degradation when resources are constrained

### 5. Human-Like Model Conversations

Models can engage in multi-turn conversations with each other:

- **Collaborative Mode**: Models build upon each other's ideas
- **Debate Mode**: Models challenge assumptions and present different perspectives
- **Critical Mode**: Models identify potential issues and edge cases
- **Brainstorming Mode**: Models generate diverse creative ideas
